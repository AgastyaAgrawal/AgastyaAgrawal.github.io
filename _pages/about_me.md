Hi! I am Agastya Agrawal, a second-year undergraduate at the [Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI)](https://www.cmi.ac.in/), pursuing my bachelor's in mathematics and computer science. I am passionate about interpreting artificial intelligence to help drive progress toward safe superintelligence. I particularly enjoy analyzing neural networks through a rigorous mathematical lens, and I am interested in applying mathematics, probability, and statistics to understand complex real-world structures. Please head to my blog or research section to learn more! You may also find my cv on the webpage for some brief histor

I also occasionally record my coding sessions on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@agastyaagrawal4688?si=aLVBVt2Gstl_qTco). Head there to check them out!


During my free time, I like solving puzzles to keep my brain fresh and trained (try this for now: [riddle](https://almostsurely.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/curves-on-a-sphere/)).
I also like to occasionally play cards and poker. I used to frequently play chess, now I do so occasionally. My favorite genres in books are:  philosophy, logic, political history, and my textbooks, of course!
The current book I am reading is Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark, and I like it so far and recommend it to others. 

*I am always open to collaborations or casual chats about these topics, so please don't hesitate to reach out! You may be interested in reaching out to my personal or university mail.*
