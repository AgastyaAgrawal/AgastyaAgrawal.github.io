I am currently collaborating with Yufeng Zhao to further understand deceptive models with unfaithful Chain of Thought. This work builds upon my previous independent research. Work is ongoing and this will be updated when publishable progress is documented. 

*More details and formal write-ups will be posted here as the research progresses.*
