For my Reinforcement Learning course project, I am exploring the topic of "Phase Transitions in RL, a singular learning perspective." 

I am currently in the exploratory phase, studying statistical learning theory to refine the exact problem I will tackle for meaningful research. Check out my blog for notes and mathematical insights related to this coursework!
