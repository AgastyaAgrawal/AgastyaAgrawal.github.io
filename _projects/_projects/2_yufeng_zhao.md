I am currently collaborating with Yufeng Zhao to further understand deceptive models with unfaithful Chain of Thought. This work builds upon my previous independent research. Work is ongoing and this will soon be updated when we something publishable is created. 

*More details and formal write-ups will be posted here as the research progresses.*
